The Googles Open Source Programs office works with the open source community to identify and fund exciting projects for the upcoming summer. The FFII is applying as a mentor organization and is looking for students who would like to code on our projects.\r\nMore Info about GSoC here: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015\r\n\r\n### Student Check List\r\nIf you want to participate in GSoC as a student, you should do your best to persuade us that you are the best candidate.\r\n* Show us some code you've written in the past. Provide links to projects where you participated if there are any. \r\n* Get involved as soon as possible with the FFII's projects.\r\n* Introduce yourself on the mailing list: https://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/devel\r\n* Submit patches for bugs or new features, so that we can see your code before starting big GSoC project. \r\n* Write good proposal.\r\n* Define goals of your proposal, we should see quickly what is topic of your proposal.\r\n* Clearly define deliverables.\r\n* At least define what you expect to deliver in mid-term and as a final results.\r\n* It is good to define optional deliverables also. \r\n* Show your commitment to the project. \r\n\r\n#GSoC Ideas\r\n## Grical\r\nGriCal (which is a short form for Grid Calendar) is an open web where people store quickly a few information about interesting events, so that others can also easily know about them. GriCal also makes easy and fast to get notified and store interesting events in its own external calendars. GriCal offers its content as free content allowing its reuse by any party under the conditions of the CC-BY-SA license. Its source code is Free Software and thus respects the Open Knowledge Definition and the Open Software Service Definition of the Open Knowledge Foundation. Events in GriCal can be edited by anyone like pages of the Wikipedia. The description of an event is rendered using ReStructuredText syntax. You can subscribe to an event (or to the result of filters) to get notified of any change, comment, or new event matching a filter.\r\n* Possible Mentor: Ivan Fernando Villanueva\r\n* Sample Code: https://github.com/zhiyajun11/gricalx\r\n* Website: http://grical.org\r\n* Mailing List: https://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/devel\r\n\r\n### Project 1\r\nImplement Markup Editor for Gridcal events\r\n\r\n### Project 2\r\nImplement different formats for Grical including JSON, RSS, Atom and add Calendar integrations with services such a Google Calendar and automatic synchronisation\r\n\r\n##  Groff (GNU troff)\r\nGroff is a typesetting system that reads plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted output. Output may be PostScript or PDF, html, or ASCII/UTF8 for display at the terminal. Formatting commands may be either low-level typesetting requests (“primitives”) or macros from a supplied set. Users may also write their own macros. All three may be combined. Present on most Unix systems owing to its long association with Unix manuals (manpages), groff is capable of producing typographically sophisticated documents while consuming only minimal system resources. \r\n* License: GNU General Public License.\r\n* Mentors: User issues lead: Ted Harding, Technical issues lead: Werner Lemberg\r\n* Code: https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=groff\r\n* Website: http://groff.ffii.org\r\n* Mailing List: http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/groff/\r\n\r\n## Parliament Data Information and Scraping Systems\r\nParltrack is a European initiative to improve the transparency of legislative processes. It combines information on dossiers, representatives, vote results and committee agendas into a unique database and allows the tracking of dossiers using email and RSS. Most of the data presented is also available for further processing in JSON format. Using Parltrack it's easy to see at a glance which dossiers are being handled by committees and MEPs.\r\n* License: Affero GPL v3+\r\n* Mentors: Andre Rebentisch\r\n* Code: https://github.com/pudo/parltrack/\r\n* Website: http://parltrack.euwiki.org\r\n* Mailing List: https://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/mepdb-parl\r\n\r\n### Project\r\nImplement Open Data Visualizations of Parliament Decisions\r\n\r\n## CJK Internationalisation of Text Processing\r\nCJK stands for \"Chinese, Japanese, Korean\". The goal of the FFII project for Internationalisation of Text Processing is to embed Asian text into texts document using the Latin alphabet.\r\n* Mentor: Hartmut Pilch\r\n* Mailing List: http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/cjk\r\n\r\n## Crypto-Stick for Encrypted Key Communication\r\nThe Crypto Stick is a USB stick in a small form factor containing an integrated OpenPGP smart card to allow easy and high-secure encryption e.g. of e-mail or for authentication in network environments. As opposed to ordinary software solutions, private keys are always inside the Crypto Stick so that their exposure is impossible. All cryptographic operations (precisely: decryption and signature because of public key cryptography) are executed on the PIN-protected Crypto Stick. In case the Crypto Stick was stolen, got lost, or is used on a virus-contaminated computer (e.g. Trojan horse) no attacker is able to access the private keys so that all encrypted data stays secure. The Crypto Stick is developed as a non-profit open source project and ensures a very high level of security due to verifiability and an attractive price. The open interface of the used OpenPGP smart card allows optimal compatibility with various software applications (e.g. GnuPG, Mozilla Thunderbird + Enigmail, OpenSSH, Linux PAM, OpenVPN, Mozilla Firefox).\r\n* Mentor: Jan Suhr\r\n* Project Site: https://tasks.ffii.org/projects/cryptostick\r\n* Code: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/cryptostick\r\n* Mailing List: https://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/crypto\r\n\r\n# About FFII\r\nThe FFII is a not-for-profit association active in over fifty countries, dedicated to the development of information goods for the public benefit, based on copyright, free competition, and open standards.
