GriCal also makes easy and fast to get notified and store interesting events in its own external calendars. GriCal offers its content as free content allowing its reuse by any party under the conditions of the CC-BY-SA license. Its source code is Free Software and thus respects the Open Knowledge Definition and the Open Software Service Definition of the Open Knowledge Foundation. Events in GriCal can be edited by anyone like pages of the Wikipedia. The description of an event is rendered using ReStructuredText syntax. You can subscribe to an event (or to the result of filters) to get notified of any change, comment, or new event matching a filter.\r\n* Project: Implement Markup Editor for Gridcal events\r\n* PRoject: Implement different formats for Grical including JSON, RSS, Atom and add Calendar integrations with services such a Google Calendar and automatic synchronisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# About FFII\r\n* http://ffii.org\r\n* http://blog.ffii.org","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
